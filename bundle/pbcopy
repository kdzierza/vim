once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
tis some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door
only this and nothing more
ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore
